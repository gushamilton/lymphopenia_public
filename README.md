# Lymphopenia CPRD data
This is to accompany the lymphopenia CPRD data and was produced by Fergus Hamilton at the Bristol Medical School (fh6520@bristol.ac.uk).

The code included shows the development of the Cox regression models and the plot generation. Unfortunately, generation of the database was not included, as that was performed as part of an earlier project.

CPRD data are available on request from the MHRA.
